Net::OpenVPN::Manage

Interact with a running OpenVPN 2.0.X process 
via it's management interface.

Perl Version:
	5.6.x or 5.8.x both work fine.

Requirements: 
	Net::Telnet - I use version 3.03, but any should do.

Installation: 
	Un-tar-gzip the archive, this is pure perl so no compiler needed
Win32 systems will need the free nmake tool from microsoft per usual.
There really isn't anything to test against when installing so no testing is available.

Unix/Linux:
  perl ./Makefile.PL
  make
  make install
  
Win32:
  perl .\Makefile.PL
  nmake
  nmake install


Note:
	This module is fairly rudimentary, if you have any problems give it a quick 
look through. I have tested it against beta 2.0 OpenVPN releases and am using it now
with the 2.0.7 release. I have NOT tried this with the current BETA 2.1 release.

Net-OpenVPN-Manage-1.0

Provides: Net::OpenVPN::Manage

Interact with a running OpenVPN 2.0.X process 
via it's management interface.

Perl Version:
	5.6.x or 5.8.x both work fine.

Requirements: 
	Net::Telnet - I use version 3.04, but any should do.

Installation: 
	Un-tar-gzip the archive, this is pure perl so no compiler needed
Win32 systems will need the free nmake tool from microsoft per usual.
There really isn't anything to test against when installing so no testing is available.

Unix/Linux:
  perl ./Makefile.PL
  make
  make install
  
Win32:
  perl .\Makefile.PL
  nmake
  nmake install


Note:
	This module is fairly rudimentary; if you have any problems give it a quick 
look through. With the exception of calls to the "load-stats" management interface
command, which was implemented in OpenVPN v2.1, all features should be compatible 
with OpenVPN v2.0 and later. I am using it now with OpenVPN 2.3.2.
